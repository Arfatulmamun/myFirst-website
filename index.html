            <p>Full stack technology refers to the entire depth of a computer system application, and full stack
                developers straddle two separate web development domains: the front end and the back end. The front end
                includes everything that a client, or site viewer, can see and interact with.</p>

            <h1>How Become a Web Developer</h1>

            <p>Small businesses often employ them to take care of the whole process of website development. The first
                step towards having a career as a full-stack developer is to educate yourself. Learn the necessary
                programming languages and other technical skills</p>
